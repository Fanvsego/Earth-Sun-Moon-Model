The main objective is as follows: to model and visualize (i.e., animate) the motion of the Moon around the Earth, while both bodies simultaneously orbit the Sun (the Sun is considered stationary for the purpose of the model). 
All necessary data regarding the sizes, masses, positions, orbital velocities of the celestial bodies, as well as parameters of their orbits, have been obtained from publicly available sources.
For the sake of convenience, a logarithmic scale has been chosen for the sizes of the celestial bodies and their orbits in the animation. 
Based on this model, an algorithm has been developed to predict upcoming total and partial solar eclipses at a given point on the Earth's surface (the point is specified by the user via longitude and latitude).
